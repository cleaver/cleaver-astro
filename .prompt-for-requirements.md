I need a detailed requirements document for rebuilding my website, cleaver.ca, using Astro.js. The current website is a simple blog with the following structure:

    A paginated list of articles on the homepage.

    A dedicated page for each individual article.

    An "About" page.

The key requirements for the new website are:

    Simplicity: The design and implementation should be as simple and maintainable as possible.

    Zero JavaScript (by default): The website should function without any client-side JavaScript enabled. Any interactive elements should be achieved through server-side rendering or HTML/CSS features. JavaScript should only be added if absolutely necessary and with careful consideration.

    No Cookies: The website should not use any cookies for tracking or functionality.

    Performance: The website should be highly performant, with fast loading times.

The requirements document should cover the following aspects in detail:

1.  Content and Data:

        1 How will the existing content (articles, about page text, etc.) be migrated to the new Astro.js site? What format will the content be stored in (e.g., Markdown files, a headless CMS)?

        2 What metadata is required for each article (e.g., title, date, author, tags, description)?

        3 How will images be handled and optimized?

2.  Website Structure and Pages:

        1 Detailed description of the homepage, including pagination requirements (e.g., number of articles per page, pagination controls).

        2 Detailed description of the article pages, including how metadata will be displayed.

        3 Detailed description of the "About" page.

        4 Define the URL structure for each type of page (homepage, article pages, about page).

3.  Design and Styling:

        1 General design guidelines and aesthetic preferences (refer to the existing site for inspiration, but also consider modern, clean designs).

        2 Specific requirements for typography, color palette, and visual elements.

        3 How will the site be made responsive and accessible?

        4 Consider using Tailwind CSS or a similar utility-first CSS framework for styling.

4.  Functionality:

        1 How will the article list be paginated?

        2 How will related articles (if any) be displayed?

        3 How will a sitemap be generated?

        4 How will an RSS feed be generated?

5.  Technical Requirements:

        1 Specify the Astro.js version to be used.

        2 Specify any other libraries or dependencies to be used (e.g., Markdown processing libraries, syntax highlighting).

        3 Describe the preferred hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

        4 Describe the build and deployment process.

        5 How will the site be monitored for errors and performance?

6.  SEO Requirements:

        1 How will meta descriptions and other SEO tags be managed?

        2 How will the site be optimized for search engines?

        3 Requirements for generating a sitemap.xml and robots.txt file.

7.  Accessibility:

        1 Adherence to WCAG guidelines.

        2 Keyboard navigation requirements.

        3 Semantic HTML structure.

        4 Alternative text for images.

8.  Future Considerations:

        1 Potential future features (e.g., search functionality, commenting system) and how they might be implemented without compromising the "no JavaScript by default" requirement.

Please provide a comprehensive and detailed document in markdown format covering all of these aspects. If there is anything uncertain, please ask one question at a time.
