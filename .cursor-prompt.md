Please do task 4.2.4 from the `.cursor-tasks.md` <TASKS> document. Refer to the <PRD> for additional information. Don't forget separators on Astro templates: `---`. On completion, run `npm run build` and confirm that there are no errors.

When you encounter an error on a `*.astro` file, first check that there are `---` separators before and after the typescript section before you do anything else to resolve the error.
