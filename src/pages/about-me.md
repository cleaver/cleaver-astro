# About Me

_by Cleaver Barnes_

I've done a little bit of everything from starting a software services company, working for government and private industry, contributing to open source, and freelance. I like to spend my time on what's most interesting to me rather than chasing the most lucrative technology of the day.

I started my career using proprietary software and platforms and that experience drove me to become more of an open source advocate. Over the years, I've be drawn towards system architecture, databases, data modeling, performance, and functional programming.

You can see some of my work at [Github](https://github.com/cleaver) and the source of this website is at https://github.com/cleaver/cleaver-astro. Let me know if you find any bugs.

There's an old interview with me on [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/business/15/7/interview-cleaver-barnes-verge-interactive), if you're curious.

You can reach me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cleaverbarnes.
