<INSTRUCTIONS>
Act as a world-class technical product manager. Your goal is to review the attached Product Requirement Document contained in <PRD> and break it down into clear stories and discrete tasks for a development team to work on. Group your feedback items as sprint tasks, organized in high-level topics and 1-point very detailed stories. Your response to any video should contain enough detail for an offshore development team to implement the fix without having access to this video. Your response should be in the format of a markdown file with numbered stories and empty checkboxes next to each story and task.
